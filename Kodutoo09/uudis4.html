        <p class="tekst"><b>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</b> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <br>
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen<br>
             book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br>
             It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop<br>
              publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
